        <div class="title">Data</div>
        14640 tweets from 7700 users were analyzed. Twitter data was scraped from February of 2015 and contributors were asked to first classify positive, negative, and neutral tweets, followed by categorizing negative reasons (such as "late flight" or "rude service").

      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Overall Sentiment</div>
        More than 60% of the reported sentiments were negative. I next investigate how the sentiments vary across airlines.
